# 2140_Final_Project
1. Who is on your team? If you are working with a partner, how will the labor be divided? 

2. An overview of the project similar in scope and length to the example projects listed below.

3. A short description of the structure of your project. How many classes will you write? What the methods be for each class? (You can change this if it turns out a better structure would work better once you start writing code and you decide to refactor. Just try to come up with a reasonable one for the proposal.)

4. What libraries and tools will you need to learn to use?

5. Identify the highest-priority features, the medium-priority features, and the lowest-priority features for your project.
